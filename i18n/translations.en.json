As talking to your database often forms a significant portion of the input and output of your application, it's important to do that asynchronously as well. With the release of version 1.4, SQLAlchemy added support for Asynchronous I/O for both its core and ORM features. This means that you can now use the popular SQL toolkit for Python in your asynchronous applications.",
              "p2": "In my talk, I will introduce you to the newly added support for asyncio in SQLAlchemy. I will go over how easy it is to set up the new AsyncEngine, point you to some of the differences with synchronous SQLAlchemy, and show you some of the pitfalls to avoid. In addition, I will also show you how you can run your existing synchronous SQLAlchemy code asynchronously to help you transition to a fully asynchronous application. By the end of my talk, you should know enough to start your own asynchronous SQLAlchemy adventure."

In addition, security vulnerabilities can be present in the source code of the package. In this talk, we will address the security issues related to python packaging and possible solutions to make python packages secure. The talk begins with the importance of a secure package and vulnerabilities in the Python package index.

They predict the probability that a specific customer might churn, at various time intervals. I used PySurvival and Lifelines Python packages to predict churn. They provide a blend of standard/traditional survival analysis models as well as the ability to incorporate modern deep learning architectures using PyTorch models.",

To identify what is the most popular programming language for AI and neural network, Python has taken a big lead with lots of outstanding libraries. However, the whole AI ecosystem is not friendly to web developers with different tech stack. In order to enable front-end developers to understand big data and build/train AI models easily, we develop Datacook, a machine learning and data analysis library in JavaScript. Meanwhile, to make this work applied in real production environment, we build Pipcook, a JavaScript end-to-end platform for building production ML pipelines based on Tensorflow.js. This talk will focus on thoughts behind Datacook/Pipcook and how we use them to apply AI in front-end area."

              "p3": "For me as an API developer, GRAPHQL has many benefits, including the fact that I develop a very large portion of the required APIs very quickly and the user uses them as needed. This means that I do not have to hard code all the requirements on the server; I create a platform that covers a very large part of the requirements.",
              "p4": "On the other hand, the user-side developer is no longer waiting for me to do a new server-side development for every need. He himself can cover a large part of his needs from the provided platform.",
              "p5": "Another advantage is that GRAPHQL solves the problem of OVER-FETCHING and UNDER-FETCHING.",
              "p6": "UNDER-FETCHING occurs when the server-side developer does not send all the data to save resources, especially the data that is sent from the server, and saves on sending data.",
              "p7": "OVER-FETCHING occurs when the server-side developer for various reasons, including a decrease in the number of queries from the client, sends large amounts of data in one call. Using GRAPHQL, each client identifies exactly what data it needs and receives exactly the same data from the server. ",
              "p8": "GRAPHQL is a new way of developing an API that will bring many benefits. In addition, security issues must be considered. This workshop also tries to address some of the security concerns."
